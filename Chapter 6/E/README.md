The Fibonacci numbers are members of an interesting sequence in which each number is equal to the sum
of the previous two numbers. In other words,
Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2
where Fi refers to the ith Fibonacci number. By definition, the first two Fibonacci numbers equal 1; i.e.,
F i = F 2 = 1 .
Hence,
F3 = F2 + F1= 1 + 1 = 2
F4 = F3 + F2 = 2 + 1 = 3
Fs = F4 + F3 = 3 + 2 = 5
and so on.


Test the program with n = 7, n = 10, n= 17 and n = 23.
